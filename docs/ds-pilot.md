# Data Stories Pilot Research

The pilot observational study developed four ALA Data Stories:
- Data provenance
- Observations, Species and Places
- Change and seasonality
- Governance and intervention

The stories can be found at (ALA Data Stories)[https://observablehq.com/collection/@mtchl/ala-data-story-sketches] The themes and elements of the stories were developed by the team, and generated through a series of meetings. The main themes are reflected in the titles. An overarching theme of the stories is place-based experience of biodiversity, and the ways in which it is vivified by biodiversity data platforms.

The pilot study of how the Data Stories engaged people in the ALA platform and its data used focus groups and interviews. In these events, participants navigated through the data stories, facilitated by interviewers and group facilitators. The Data Stories typically contain a number of sections, each comprising some text, some data-derived elements, and a set of text prompts for discussion.

## Experimental elements in the Data Stories

The Data Stories rely on a set of web-browser based views of ALA data. A deliberately limited collection of mostly standard interactive graphic elements were used in these stories:
- maps, 
- tables, 
- images, 
- static and scrolling lists, 
- hyperlinks, 
- search boxes
- text boxes 

We refer to those elements as ‘devices,’ partly to reflect the fact that they have reactive or interactive interface controls. They have some kind of controls, and  they are intended to generate certain effects such as surprise and curiosity.

## The events and their participants
Interviews with individuals were arranged through personal contacts. Interviewees included people involved in volunteer groups, people working as citizen scientists, people doing conservation work and people with a general interest in the ALA. Focus groups with conducted with final year conservation and biodiversity students, and a selection of interested ALA users who included teachers, public servants, environmental consultants, conservation volunteers, mostly from Australia.
Due to time constraints in the interviews and focus groups, participants were asked to work through a subset of the four data stories. The focus groups were given a brief introduction to the ALA. Interviewees had a chance to discuss their general familiarity with the ALA at the outset.

Depending on how fast discussion progressed, the typically engaged with three data stories. Some groups moved quite slowly and only engaged one story. Interview and focus group sessions ran for 1.5-2.5 hours. Two of the focus groups were run online using video conferencing. One of the focus groups also entered written responses to the text prompts in a Google Form.

Pilot study of data stories using focus groups and interviews. 3 focus groups of 8-12 people held at ALA or online (1.5-2 hours) 4 individual interviews (1-1.5 hours)

## Summary findings from the pilot research
The scrolly-telling format has some promise as a way of opening paths for people to follow in navigating ALA as a platform for biodiversity data. Via the Data Stories, participants all managed to spend substantial time ‘on’ the ALA platform. 
Familiar elements of the format – maps, images, lists – are valued by participants. The devices however, also  bring with them uncertainties and disorientation, sometimes relating to the formatting of biodiversity data, sometimes concerning the content or significance of what they encounter through them, and sometimes relating to how devices should be used.
Data Stories that are not  fully integrated with the ALA platform occasion confusion for people with some familiarity or established practices on the ALA.
What we might call ‘biodiversity data literacy’ is a significant issue for users of the ALA, and at various points this hinders progress through the Data Stories. The motivation for collecting observations, awareness of taxonomic differences, or knowing how to look beyond the most common occurrences cannot be assumed.
Themes relating to extinction, conservation and climate change engendered the most discussion and interest, followed by curiousity about where ALA data comes from and how it relates to particular interests, or social groups.
