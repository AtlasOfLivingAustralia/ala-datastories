# Themes and Design Goals

## Themes

The following themes emerged consistently across the observational research with ALA users, and discussions with ALA staff and within the research team:

- **Accessibility for non-experts:** Many non-expert users found the ALA overwhelming or impenetrable. ALA staff reported increasing interest from diverse user groups. 

- **Data as produced:** In design investigations and conversations we consistently observed the complexity of data in the ALA, and the ways that it shows traces of its own production. Biodiversity data is produced through interactions and encounters between human activity and non-human lifeforms. This data reflects social practices (such as citizen science) as well as institutional and governmental structures. 

- **Species and place:** ALA users relate strongly to place and to map-based representations. They are also interested in species as distinct from occurrences.
Given the diversity of habitats represented within the ALA, how might we show the characteristic lifeforms of a place, when commonly observed species and lifeforms are so numerous within the ALA?  

- **Conservation:** ALA users are highly aware of the threats to Australian biodiversity and motivated by concern for and interest in threatened species.


The project's design goals were framed by:
1. Ongoing discussion with ALA team
2. Piloting design elements using a set of data stories in interviews and focus groups with a spectrum of interested people ranging from general public through students, conservationists, parkcare volunteers, wildlife rescuers, teachers interested in biodiversity and environmentalism.
3. Reflecting on and consolidating insights and outcomes from 1 and 2 into an integrated “enriched” interface 


## Design Goals

### Design Goals
- Generosity
- Show features and relationships in the data without requiring a search - because we found that many users of the data stories didn’t have a query or don’t have the knowledge required to form a query; 
- Provide visual and interactive representations showing data extent, distribution and diversity.
- Provide multiple, concurrent and connected views of ALA data
- Implemented in: facets, species bubbles, hex map, sample observations- 

### Explorability
- Enable users to easily navigate ALA data across multiple dimensions, and discover and interpret data points, relationships and patterns, both in this interface and other views of the ALA
- Implemented in: facets, species bubbles, ALA deep links- 

### Discovery
- Enable users to make discoveries - encountering new, salient information - without requiring a well formed query
- Implemented in: facets, species bubbles, sample observations  - 

### Accessibility
- Enable users to explore ALA data regardless of their level of existing knowledge or expertise
- Implemented in: lifeform facets, species bubbles, sample observations  - 

### Flexibility
- Develop general-purpose approaches and techniques that can be applied across the Atlas.
- Demonstrate elements that can be adapted and applied in other contexts across the Atlas
- Provide multiple pathways for navigation and exploration
- Support a wide range of devices and screen sizes- 

### Delight
- Be visually enjoyable, functionally performant and responsive
