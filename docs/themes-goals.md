# Themes and Design Goals

## Themes

The project's design goals were informed by following themes, which emerged consistently across the observational research with ALA users, and discussions with ALA staff and within the research team:

- **Accessibility for non-experts:** Many non-expert users found the ALA overwhelming or impenetrable. ALA staff reported increasing interest from diverse user groups. 

- **Data as produced:** In design investigations and conversations we consistently observed the complexity of data in the ALA, and the ways that it shows traces of its own production. Biodiversity data is produced through interactions and encounters between human activity and non-human lifeforms. This data reflects social practices (such as citizen science) as well as institutional and governmental structures. 

- **Species and place:** ALA users relate strongly to place and to map-based representations. They are also interested in species as distinct from occurrences.
Given the diversity of habitats represented within the ALA, how might we show the characteristic lifeforms of a place, when commonly observed species and lifeforms are so numerous within the ALA?  

- **Conservation:** ALA users are highly aware of the threats to Australian biodiversity and motivated by concern for and interest in threatened species.
